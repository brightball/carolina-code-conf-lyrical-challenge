# Lyrical Code Challenge for the 2026 Carolina Code Conference

This will be our 4th year in a row with our polyglot, lyrical code t-shirt and we're excited!

The goal is to turn these song lyrics (below) into code in any/every language you can think of. As entries come in if you think you can improve something, feel free to submit a PR doing exactly that. Assuming we get enough entries, we're going assemble the results into our 2026 Carolina Code Conference t-shirt.

## What do you mean, song lyrics as code?

A genius of some sort created this [Bohemian Rhapsody as Code t-shirt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/400920/235378344-93d0ef0a-0913-4109-bd4d-638d3da32eae.png). I own one and it's a lot of fun, so we used it as an [inspiration to for a polyglot version](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/lyrical-code-challenge-dont-stop) of [Don't Stop Believing in 2023](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/our-crowdsourced-shirt-is-ready) and then paid homage to the original with our polyglot [Bohemian Rhapsody shirt in 2024](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/our-2024-lyrical-code-t-shirt-is). The shirts were such as hit that we've decided to turn it into an annual event, selecting a new song each year and with participants [finding more ways to be creative](lilypond/bohemianrhapsody.chruck.ly).

Here are the results of our prior years:

- 2023 - [Don't Stop Believing - Journey](https://github.com/brightball/carolina-code-conf-lyrical-challenge/blob/main/completed_versions/dontstopbelieving/final.md)
- 2024 - [Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen](https://github.com/brightball/carolina-code-conf-lyrical-challenge/blob/main/completed_versions/bohemianrhapsody/final.md)
- 2025 - [Allstar - Smash Mouth](https://github.com/brightball/carolina-code-conf-lyrical-challenge/blob/main/completed_versions/allstar/final.md)

For 2026...we have been ["Rickrolled"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) (*smh*). We all saw it coming the moment that Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" [appeared on the nominations](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/round-1-2026-lyrical-code-challenge) for this year...[and it did](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/final-four-2026-lyrical-code-challenge). Here's [this year's official announcement](https://blog.carolina.codes/i/171655195/weve-been-rickrolled) in the [2025 Recap Post](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/2025-recap-finally).

## How to submit a PR

To enter, fork this repo and add a directory for the language you want to use. Then create a file using the song title and your github username, like so:

```bash
# Examples

ruby/never-gonna-give-you-up-brightball.rb

java/NeverGonnaGiveYouUpBrightball.java

elixir/never-gonna-give-you-up-brightball.exs
```

Then just submit your PR! Bonus points and social media thank yous for broadcasting it and tagging us on your favorite social channels. You can do specific versese, specific lines or the entire song if you like!

Remember, it's more important that the code reads than actually compiles. This is going on a t-shirt, not your production server. The goal is to create an experience where you can't help but sing the song in your head as you read each line of the code.

Feel free to reference [prior year's entries](https://github.com/brightball/carolina-code-conf-lyrical-challenge/tree/main/completed_versions) for inspiration and examples.  Above all, have fun with it.

## Never Gonnag Give You Up - Rick Astley

[Lyrics](https://genius.com/Rick-astley-never-gonna-give-you-up-lyrics) | [Music Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

```
[Verse 1]
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinkin' of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

[Verse 2]
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been goin' on
We know the game, and we're gonna play it

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
```
