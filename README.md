# Lyrical Code Challenge 2024 for the Carolina Code Conference

See the [announcement blog post](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/lyrical-code-challenge-dont-stop?sd=pf) for full details!

The goal is to turn these song lyrics (below) into code in any/every language you can think of. As entries come in if you think you can improve something, feel free to submit a PR doing exactly that. Assuming we get enough entries, we're going assemble the results into our 2024 Carolina Code Conference t-shirt.

## What do you mean, song lyrics as code?

A genius of some sort created this Bohemian Rhapsody as Code t-shirt. I own one and it's a lot of fun, so we used it as an [inspiration to for a polyglot version](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/lyrical-code-challenge-dont-stop) of [Don't Stop Believing in 2023](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/our-crowdsourced-shirt-is-ready). The shirts were such as hit that we've decided to turn it into an annual event, selecting a new song each year.

This year after [20 songs were nominated](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/round-1-2024-lyrical-code-challenge), we had 2 rounds of voting [before selecting...Bohemian Rhapsody](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/final-round-cast-your-vote-for-this)! It was going to happen eventually so this is the year.  You can use the original shirt as inspiration, but don't be afraid to be creative with your favorite language!

Here's this year's official announcement.

## How to submit a PR

To enter, fork this repo and add a directory for the language you want to use. Then create a file using the song title and your github username, like so:

```bash
# Examples

ruby/bohemian-rhapsody-brightball.rb

java/BohemianRhapsodyBrightball.java

elixir/bohemian-rhapsody-brightball.exs
```

Then just submit your PR! Bonus points and social media thank yous for broadcasting it and tagging us on your favorite social channels.

Remember, it's more important that the code reads than actually compiles. This is going on a t-shirt, not your production server. Above all, have fun with it.

Here's an example to get you started.

```ruby
girl = Person.new(sex: 'female', age: 18, from: 'a small town')
girl.currently_lives_in = 'a lonely world'

train = Transportation.new(type: 'train', departs_at: 'midnight', destination: 'anywhere')
girl.transport(train)

boy = Person.new(sex: 'male', age: 18, from: 'South Detroit')
boy.transport(train)
```

[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
```
