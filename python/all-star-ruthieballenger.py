# Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
# I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

# She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
# In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

# Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
while years:
    years+=years
# Didn't make sense not to live for fun
# Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
head = isBrainSmart()

# So much to do so much to see
# So what's wrong with taking the back streets

if all(wrong):
    takeTheBackStreets()

# You'll never know if you don't go
# You'll never shine if you don't glow

# [Chorus:]
# Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
# Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
# And all that glitters is gold
# Only shooting stars break the mold

# It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
while coolPlace:
    colder+=colder
# You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
if bundled:
    os.wait()
# But the meteor men beg to differ
# Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

# The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
# The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
# My world's on fire how about yours
# That's the way I like it and I never get bored

# [Repeat Chorus 2x]

# Somebody once asked could you spare some change for gas
# I need to get myself away from this place
# I said yep what a concept
# I could use a little fuel myself
# And we could all use a little change
# Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
# Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
# Didn't make sense not to live for fun
# Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
# So much to do so much to see
# So what's wrong with taking the back streets

# You'll never know if you don't go
# You'll never shine if you don't glow

# [Repeat Chorus]
