# Lyrical Code Challenge for the 2025 Carolina Code Conference

This will be our 3rd years in a row with our polyglot, lyrical code t-shirt and we're excited!

The goal is to turn these song lyrics (below) into code in any/every language you can think of. As entries come in if you think you can improve something, feel free to submit a PR doing exactly that. Assuming we get enough entries, we're going assemble the results into our 2025 Carolina Code Conference t-shirt.

## What do you mean, song lyrics as code?

A genius of some sort created this [Bohemian Rhapsody as Code t-shirt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/400920/235378344-93d0ef0a-0913-4109-bd4d-638d3da32eae.png). I own one and it's a lot of fun, so we used it as an [inspiration to for a polyglot version](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/lyrical-code-challenge-dont-stop) of [Don't Stop Believing in 2023](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/our-crowdsourced-shirt-is-ready) and then paid homage to the original with our polyglot [Bohemian Rhapsody shirt in 2024](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/our-2024-lyrical-code-t-shirt-is). The shirts were such as hit that we've decided to turn it into an annual event, selecting a new song each year and with participants [finding more ways to be creative](lilypond/bohemianrhapsody.chruck.ly).

For 2025, we let our 2024 conference attendees vote over 2 days to pick the song. First an [initial round with 20 songs in 5 brackets](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/round-1-2025-lyrical-code-challenge), followed by a [final round with the bracket winners](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/lyrical-code-challenge-2025-final) where All Star by Smash Mouth won for 2025!

Here's this year's [official announcement](https://blog.carolina.codes/i/148154944/youre-an-all-star) in the [2024 wrap up post](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/2024-carolina-code-conference-wrap).

## How to submit a PR

To enter, fork this repo and add a directory for the language you want to use. Then create a file using the song title and your github username, like so:

```bash
# Examples

ruby/all-star-brightball.rb

java/AllStarBrightball.java

elixir/all-star-brightball.exs
```

Then just submit your PR! Bonus points and social media thank yous for broadcasting it and tagging us on your favorite social channels. You can do specific versese, specific lines or the entire song if you like!

Remember, it's more important that the code reads than actually compiles. This is going on a t-shirt, not your production server. The goal is to create an experience where you can't help but sing the song in your head as you read each line of the code.

Feel free to reference 2023's [Don't Stop Believing](completed_versions/dontstopbelieving/final.md) and 2024's [Bohemian Rhapsody](completed_versions/bohemianrhapsody/final.md) for inspiration and examples.  Above all, have fun with it.

## All Star - Smash Mouth

```
[Verse 1]
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shootin' stars break the mold

[Verse 2]
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
The water's gettin' warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(All that glitters is gold)
Only shootin' stars break the mold
